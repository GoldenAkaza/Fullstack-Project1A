# Micro CRM Leads (Project 1)

## Live Deployment
Live: https://crm-leads-tracker-1.onrender.com // The public URL where the live application can be accessed (from Render).

## Run Locally

### Setup Instructions
<p>npm install // Installs all project dependencies defined in the package.json file.<br/>
npm start // Executes the "start" script defined in package.json (e.g., node server.js).<br/>
Open http://localhost:3000/ // Instructs the user where to access the application in their browser<br/></p>

## Features

- Filter by status and search by name or company
- Update status

## Windows and macOS Notes
Open VS Code terminal. The commands are the same on both platforms.

## Reflection
<p>Through this project, I gained a practical understanding of how different web development concepts connect to form a complete full-stack workflow. Working with Node.js helped me appreciate the efficiency of the event loop and how asynchronous operations keep the application responsive. I learned that blocking operations can halt the entire process, while non-blocking code enables multiple requests to be handled concurrently, improving performance.<br/></p>

<p>Building the Express.js server clarified the importance of HTTP and routing in structuring an application. Defining endpoints and using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE demonstrated the core principles of a RESTful API, where each route serves a specific purpose and communicates through JSON data. I also developed a clearer sense of how middleware supports tasks like request parsing and static file serving.<br/></p>

<p>On the front end, I understood how client-side JavaScript interacts with API routes using fetch requests to display and modify data dynamically. Deploying the project on Render provided valuable experience in hosting real-world applications, from configuring the build process to troubleshooting deployment errors.<br/></p>

<p>Overall, this project strengthened my confidence in building a micro full-stack application, deepened my understanding of server-client communication, and highlighted the importance of structured routing and deployment.</p>
